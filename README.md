# Chat-Safely

## MOBILITY DEVELOPER TECH CAMP â€“ Team 11 & Team 20


### Problem Statement :-

To prepare a mobile application to allow users to have peer to peer chatting and also providing a
unique feature for women safety.


### Technologies Used :-

Android Studio, Kotlin, Java, XML, Firebase


### Approach to implement project :-

This is a Firebase based android application including a separate section for the women safety
in which just by pressing a button current location of the user will be sent to there selected
friends. And they can be traced further on using HERE Maps API. Most important thing to
understand the project is getting familiar with Google Firebase (online database platform).


### Timeline/Modular Segmentation of Project :-

Android developers will be designing the mobile application and firstly the important unique
feature is going to be implemented and mentees are supposed to find issues in the existing
project. And after this feature is implemented then only other features like status and group
chatting features will be implemented.
